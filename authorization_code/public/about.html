    <h1>About Us</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="about_text">
    We are a group of guys, from Texas and Georgia, that like to listen to music while we code. 
    Our first project idea was using an api to help with the paradox of choice we all find ourselves in. 
    That project sadly came to a screaching halt when we we "suspended" from using the API. So we came together 
    in the litle time we had left to complete it and decided we would just restart, and go for the notoriously 
    easy path of using Spotify Api.

    <h5><u>About Tucker:</u></h5>
    <p>I currently live in Rocky Face, Georgia. I am a Staff Sergeant in the Georgia 
      National Guard, where I am a Senior OPS Advisor at B Co 1/54th SFAB out of Fort Benning, Ga. For most of 2019 I was 
      deployed to Nangarhar, Afghanistan, where I worked and ran missions along side a team from 10th Special Forces Group. 
      There I served as a machine gun team leader, until I got promoted and was given the responsibility of an 11 man squad. 
      Shortly after that deployment I went to Texas to work along side the Border Patrol. After that I went to Elite Lineman 
      Training Institute to become a lineman, where I got second in our class rodeo, and won honor graduate.
      While working as an underground apprentice my passion for progrmaming had been rekindled due to going back 
      through a Python 3 project book. Shortly after finishing the book I 
      started back to school at Digital Crafts.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>About Matt:</u></h5>
    <p>I currently live in Conyers, Georgia. I'm studying full-stack web development at DigitalCrafts. I've previously worked as
      a independent contracter at Prime Inc. for nearly 3 years. Since then I worked as a pizza delivery driver for Papa John's.

    <p>I currently live in Houston, TX. I married my wife, Heather in 2002, we have three kids Ethan, Claire and Sophia.
      After twenty years in the oilfield, I was looking for a career change, so I enrolled in DigitalCrafts Full Stack
      Bootcamp January 2021, and began learning different coding languages. I am also working on my Bachelor's in
      Computer Science, which will be completed at the end of 2021. </p>
