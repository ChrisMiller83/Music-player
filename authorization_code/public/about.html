    <p>
    Our first project idea was using an API to help with the paradox of choice we all find ourselves in. 
    That project sadly came to a screaching halt when we were "suspended" from using the chosen API for Amazon. So we came together 
    in the litle time we had left to complete it and decided we would just restart. While listeing to music we decided to use that as 
    inspiration and go for the notoriously easy path of using Spotify Api.

    <h2><u>The Team</u></h2>
    <br>
    <h5><u>About Tucker:</u></h5>
    <p>I currently live in Rocky Face, Georgia. I am a Staff Sergeant in the Georgia 
      National Guard, where I am a Senior OPS Advisor at B Co 1/54th SFAB out of Fort Benning, Ga. For most of 2019 I was 
      deployed to Nangarhar, Afghanistan, where I worked and ran missions along side a team from 10th Special Forces Group. 
      There I served as a machine gun team leader, until I got promoted and was given the responsibility of an 11 man squad. 
      Shortly after that deployment I went to Texas to work along side the Border Patrol. After that I went to Elite Lineman 
      Training Institute to become a lineman, where I got second in our class rodeo, and won honor graduate.
      While working as an underground apprentice my passion for progrmaming had been rekindled due to going back 
      through a Python 3 project book. Shortly after finishing the book I 
      started back to school at Digital Crafts.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>About Matt:</u></h5>
    <p>I currently live in Conyers, Georgia. I'm studying full-stack web development at DigitalCrafts. I've previously worked as
      a independent contracter at Prime Inc. for nearly 3 years. Since then I worked as a pizza delivery driver for Papa John's. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>About Michael:</u></h5>
    <p>Michael lives in Atlanta, GA with his lil pup Apollo. After several years in supply chain management, 
      he had decided to change course toward a more fulfilling career in web development. Accordingly, he is in 
      the process of completing a Full Stack Web Development course with DigitalCrafts. Other than coding, his 
      passions include music, the outdoors, and life-long learning.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>About Chris:</u></h5>
    <p>I currently live in Houston, TX. I married my wife, Heather in 2002, we have three kids Ethan, Claire and Sophia.
      After twenty years in the oilfield, I was looking for a career change, so I enrolled in DigitalCrafts Full Stack
      Bootcamp January 2021, and began learning different coding languages. I am also working on my Bachelor's in
      Computer Science, which will be completed at the end of 2021. </p>
